# **Noise Reduction**
## Method 1: Automatic de-noising of Hyper Spectral images using Shearlet based image noise reduction

### De-noising Methodology Algorithm

#### Step 1: Noise Characterisation

1. **Input:** HSI image plane \( Y_k \) for each wavelength \( k \).

2. **Output:** Classification of each image plane as low-level Gaussian noise (LGN) or high-level/mixed noise.
   - Calculate correlation coefficient \( R \) between \( Y_k \) and \( Y_{k+r} \) for neighboring wavelengths \( r \).

   - Compute mean correlation \( \overline{R}_k \) using a window \( w_1 \) around \( Y_k \). <br>

   - Median of \( \overline{R}_k \) is used as a threshold to classify as LGN or mixed noise.

### Step 2: Shearlet Transform

1. **Input:** Image planes classified as LGN or mixed noise.

2. **Output:** NSST coefficients for each image plane.
   - Apply Non-Subsampled Shearlet Transform (NSST) to decompose each image plane.
   - Use NSP filter banks for multi-scale decomposition without downsampling.
   - Use NSS filter banks for directional decomposition, iteratively applied for multi-scale and multi-directional decomposition.

      - A and D denote low and high frequency sub-images, respectively.
      - NSP refers to nonsubsampled pyramids.
      - NSS stands for nonsubsampled shearlets.
      - l values represent the sizes of the sub-images at different scales (16, 8, and 4 for scales 1, 2, and 3, respectively).

### Step 3: De-noising Image Planes

1. Input
NSST coefficients for each image plane.

2. Output
De-noised image planes.

- Apply thresholding to NSST coefficients to distinguish noise from signal.
- For LGN image planes:
  - Use BayesShrink method to determine threshold \( T_{s,t} \). <br>

  -The standard deviation (Ïƒs t, ) of the signal measured from the sub-image Ys,t at scale s and direction t is estimated as <br>

- For mixed noise image planes:
  - Fuse shearlet coefficients from adjacent LGN image planes.
  - Weighted average of coefficients based on proximity.
- Reconstruct de-noised image planes using inverse NSST.

### Final Output
- De-noised HSI image planes ready for further classification and analysis.
